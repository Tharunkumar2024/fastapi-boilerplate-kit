# FastAPI Boilerplate Kit

This is a FastAPI Boilerplate Kit to generate the basic configurations to start development and deployment-ready templates.

## Features:
- **FastAPI Boilerplate**: A simple and clean project setup for creating FastAPI applications.
- **Pre-configured Templates**: Includes templates for essential files such as `main.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and others.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Generate a new FastAPI project with a single command.
- **Production-Ready Setup**: Provides a basic structure that is ready for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Installation Instructions:
To install the FastAPI Boilerplate Kit, run:

```
pip install fastapi-boilerplate-kit
```

Alternatively, you can install from the test PyPI repository for testing purposes:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ fastapi-boilerplate-kit
```

### Generate a New Project
Once the installation is complete, you can generate a new FastAPI project using the CLI:

```
dnd generate PROJECT_NAME
```

This will create a new project directory named `PROJECT_NAME` with the default structure for a FastAPI project.

### Project Setup
1. **Change to the generated project directory**:
```
cd PROJECT_NAME
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Start the FastAPI server**:
```
python main.py
```

4. **Access the Swagger Docs**: Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

This will give you access to FastAPI's interactive API documentation.

### Project Example:
For example, after generating a project named `test_project`, the following steps are needed:
1. Change directory:
```
cd test_project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the FastAPI server:
```
python main.py
```

4. Visit the Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs` for detailed API documentation.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)
